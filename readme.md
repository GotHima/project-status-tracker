# About

## index.html

There are different `<template>` blocks which will be rendered dynamically by code. For example, when the `ProjectInput` class is instantiated, it will render the template with `id="project-input"` in the DOM.

# How to run this repo

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start a local server using `lite-server`.
